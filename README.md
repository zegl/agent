# Buildkite Agent ![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/08e4e12a0a1e478f0994eb1e8d51822c5c74d395.svg?branch=master)

_Note: This is the development branch of the buildkite-agent, and may not contain files or code in the current stable release._

The buildkite-agent is a small, reliable, and cross-platform build runner that makes it easy to run automated builds on your own infrastructure. Itâ€™s main responsibilities are polling [buildkite.com](https://buildkite.com/) for work, running build jobs, reporting back the status code and output log of the job, and uploading the job's artifacts.

Full documentation is available at [buildkite.com/docs/agent](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent)

```

## Installing

The agents page on Buildkite has personalised instructions for installing the agent with Ubuntu (via apt), Debian (via apt), macOS (via homebrew), Windows and Linux. You can also run the agent [via Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/buildkite/agent).

## Starting

To start an agent all you need is your agent token, which you can find on your Agents page within Buildkite.

```bash
buildkite-agent start --token
```

## Development

These instructions assume you are running a recent macOS, but could easily be adapted to Linux and Windows.

```bash
# Make sure you have go 1.11+ installed.
brew install go

# Download the code somewhere, no GOPATH required
git clone https://github.com/buildkite/agent.git
cd agent

# Start the agent
go run main.go start --debug --token "abc123"
```

### Dependency management

We're go 1.11+ and [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage our Go dependencies. We are keeping the dependencies vendored to remain backwards compatible with older go versions.

If you are using go 1.11 and have the agent in your `GOPATH`, you will need to enable modules via the environment variable:

```bash
export GO111MODULE=on
```

If you introduce a new package:

```bash
go get github.com/my/new/package
```

Then you can write that package to the `vendor/` with:

```bash
go mod vendor
```
