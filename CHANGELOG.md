### Added
- üêû The agent will now poll the AWS EC2 Tags API until it finds some tags to apply before continuing. In some cases, the agent will start and connect to Buildkite before the tags are available. The timeout for this polling can be configured with --wait-for-ec2-tags-timeout (which defaults to 10 seconds) #492

### Fixed

### Added
- Allow pipeline uploads when no-command-eval is true

### Fixed

### Added
- Add plugin support for HTTP repositories with .git extensions [#447]

## 3.0-beta.19 - 2017-03-29
### Added
- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job` will run the agent, and automatically disconnect after running it's first job. This has sometimes been referred to as "one shot" mode and is useful when you spin up an environment per-job and want the agent to automatically disconnect once it's finished it's job
- `buildkite-agent start --disconnect-after-job-timeout` is the time in seconds the agent will wait for that first job to be assigned. The default value is 120 seconds (2 minutes). If a job isn't assigned to the agent after this time, it will automatically disconnect and the agent process will stop.

## [2.3] - 2016-11-10

## [2.2] - 2016-09-21
### Added
- The buildkite-agent binary is now built with Golang 1.7 giving us support for macOS Sierra
- The agent now talks HTTP2 making calls to the Agent API that little bit faster

- meta-data-ec2 and meta-data-ec2-tags can now be configured using BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2 and BUILDKITE_AGENT_META_DATA_EC2_TAGS environment variables

### Changed
- We've removed our dependency of libc for greater compatibly across \*nix systems which has had a few side effects:
  We've had to remove support for changing the process title when an agent starts running a job. This feature has only ever been available to users running 64-bit ubuntu, and required us to have a dependency on libc. We'd like to bring this feature back in the future in a way that doesn't have us relying on libc
- The agent will now use Golangs internal DNS resolver instead of the one on your system. This probably won't effect you in any real way, unless you've setup some funky DNS settings for agent.buildkite.com
